Practice website for learning to code in wordpress.
Coded along as part of the Udemy course "Become A Wordpress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code". 
For websites that I coded entirely on my own, see my "Art Gallery" and "Personal Website" repositories.

A local server environment that is adequate for wordpress is required to reproduce this project. 
I have used Local by Flywheel for the project dev environment, but I have also learned to use Vagrant with Virtualbox as a project environmemt.
